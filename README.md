# CELESTIANIUM MOD 

a mod for Minecraft 1.7.10 with Forge, currently, this does not differ much from the example mod I forked yet, but, soon*, i'll add an O.P. toolset for Celestianium

### Motivation

i'm a total coding newbie, and i also like REALLY O.P. things

### Etymology
i just put "celestial" and "titanium" in a word blender

### Pronounciation
se-les-tie-ay-knee-oom
